Our goal here was to make use of modern techniques for measuring genetic activity - RNA-Seq and multiplex in situ hybridization - to cluster groups of cells according to which genes they commonly express. This is useful both for identifying where these cells are and which brain functions they are involved in, but also for gaining control of them with optogenetics and other Neuroscience methods.

I was the main person responsible for the conception, management and execution of this project. I wasn't familiar with any of the techniques or programming languages that I used here when we began, but I found it very enjoyable to learn them. The paper is currently being finalized and will be submitted shortly; in the meantime, the data is not available and the figures are redacted. This work was a collaboration between me, Mark Cembrowski, Nelson Spruston and Stefan Remy.

Key tools: R, Seurat, ggplot2, plotly.
