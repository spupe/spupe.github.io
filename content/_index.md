A former Neuroscientist looking for a first opportunity in the field of Data Science.
{{< /lead >}}

I have a strong background in academic research. For the past four years, I combined that with my lifelong interest in programming and developed data analysis and visualization pipelines in R. 

I want to combine my skills in Programming, Statistics and Data Analysis to develop a career as a Data Scientist.

Explore my [Projects]({{< ref "projects" >}}) to get a feel for what I can do. If you like what you see, check out my repositories on [Github](https://github.com/spupe) or my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/spupe).
